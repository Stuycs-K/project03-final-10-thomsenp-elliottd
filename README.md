### Project Description:

Our project is a game in which clients connect to a server, the server pushes game progression by sending out events and managing player conflicts, and the game ends when a player gets strong enough to take on and defeat the final battle.
### Instructions:
To play the game, first make server, set the number of players, and the desired difficulty. Then connect players with make player,in different terminals or computers. At any point, you can type start game on the server or a player to commence gameplay.  Otherwise, the game will begin when the set number of players connect.

Once the game begins, each turn players are given their current status, and a list of choices. They select a choice by typing the corresponding number, which then gives another prompt depending on the choice. They can do as many of the choices as they want, and when they are done they end their turn. When their turn ends, the server goes to the next turn, where the player interaction of the last turn is handled, profits are collected, and the player is prompted again.
