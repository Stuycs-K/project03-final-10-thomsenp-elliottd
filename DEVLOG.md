# Dev Log:

## Preston Thomsen

### 2024-01-02 - Out of class but planned over text
We did not attend class but both kept in contact and decided to be partners and make some sort of text based game.

### 2024-01-03 - Out of class but planned on paper
I made decisions on the organization and mechanics of the game.

### 2024-01-04 - Discourse over the final details of the game
Finally got some time face to face with Elliott to discuss our plans for the game.
Since the design and functionality of the game was largely my job I took the lead in decisions.

### 2024-01-05 - Presented my finalized plans for the game to Elliott
Elliott went over my final plans for the game and made any small adjustments that we saw as necessary.

### 2024-01-07 - Duels and wagers
Created functions for the dueling and wagering functionality of the game so that players can properly compete with each other.

### 2024-01-08 - Creation of common events
Spent time designing the player struct and the creation of common events that the player will face every round.

### 2024-01-09 - Common and uncommon events
Finishing the common events, creating uncommon events, and implementing the randomization methods for event creation.

### 2024-01-10 - Rare and server level events
Created larger and more impactful events while going back and editing smaller level events to be properly balanced with the newly created ones.

### 2024-01-11 - Quality of life edits
Testing the game with tester files to make sure that all of the functions created so far are properly functioning.

### 2024-01-12 - Functions for player action
Created and planned more functions to allow the player to have things to do each round.

### 2024-01-15 - Finalizing all functions
Creating output for each round for the player, making multiplier for specific tribes, and generally integrating with Elliott's systems code

I made decisions on the organization and mechanics of the game.

### 2024-01-04 - Discourse over the final details of the game and assignment of tasks
Both of us went over our plans for the game and created a final plan for what we want the game to feel like
Assigned tasks, I do the systems and Preston handles the game aspect but Preston still checks with me and I still can reach out to Preston for help

### 2024-01-05 - Began working along with making final minor edits to the game plan
Began using the provided code by Mr.K to implement the interaction between the server and multiple clients.

### 2024-01-07 - Divvied up files and finally understood K's sample code
Created files to help with the distribution of labor
Finally implemented Mr.K's code into my own to create a functioning(?) server.

### 2024-01-08 - Testing of server and client interaction
Successfully have the client and the server interacting but there is some sort of critical failure when more than one client is in play.

### 2024-01-09 - Checking in with Preston
Checking in with Preston and seeing how the game is developing
Working on fixing the multiple client problem

### 2024-01-10 - Spent a lot of time merging branches
Due to some errors in communication there was a lot of time spent merging my branch with the main.

### 2024-01-11 - Gave input on events
Final check in with Preston to see the progress of events and give input on balancing rewards and punishments.

### 2024-01-12 - Finalized previous work on prompting the user
Pretty simple work but making it work in tandem with the systems work already done was pretty painful.

### 2024-01-15 - Implementing with Preston Thomsen
Integrated my systems code with Preston's game code and fixing all of the resulting issues that arose from the systems code.
